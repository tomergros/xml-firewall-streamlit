# xml-firewall-streamlit
Tomer Grossman and Oriel Somech final project
Academic Advisor: Dr. Guy Leshem

An XML firewall is a securityÂ  software component designed to protect XML-based services and applications from various security threats, such as XML injection attacks, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and XML message tampering.

our mission is to provide a layer of security between the XML-based application or service and the internet, filtering and blocking potentially malicious traffic while allowing legitimate traffic to pass through.

XML firewalls can also enforce policies related to message routing, authentication, encryption, and content inspection to ensure that only authorized traffic is allowed through.

The purpose of the project is to provide a secure and automated solution for validating textual information before storing and using it in sensitive and critical areas.

Our solution is a system that given XML files with valid (non-malicious) data performs automatic validation of the XSD file.

The project aims to completely eliminate manual validation processes and prevent human errors that may lead to security breaches.
The solution involves receiving regular expressions that represent the content intended for validation in different platforms
